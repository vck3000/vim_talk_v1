## [T1 Q1] - Data types

In lectures we have covered 4 data types so far: string, integer, float and boolean.

For each of the following choose a suitable data type to hold the following pieces of information:

- Whether a light switch is on or off
- Time taken for an Olympian to run 100m
- Number of kittens that can comfortably fit in a basket
- Percentage of students who ask questions in tutorials
- Blood type
- Names of the Australian floral emblems
- Number of cups of flour to make a cake
- Colour

## [T1 Q2] - The Terminal

Ensure you have set up your Unix system. Check the "Getting Started With Python" Edstem post if you have not done so yet! For now, you can use the terminal in the Ed workspace (accessed via the top right navigation bar).

The terminal is an interface to your machine. It is much more capable (and potentially destructive) than your normal file explorer/GUI interface but it will feel very clunky at first! Open up a file explorer and try each of the following commands one at a time to see their effect! With a bit of practice, you'll get used to it very quickly!

| Command            | Description                                |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------ |
| pwd                | Print the current working directory        |
| ls                 | List the contents of the current directory |
| ls -a              | Show hidden file                           |
| mkdir engg1810     | Make a new directory called engg1810       |
| cd engg1810        | Change directory to engg1810               |
| cd ..              | Change to the parent directory             |
| cd ~               | Change to the home directory               |
| touch hello.txt    | Make a new file called hello.txt           |
| rm hello.txt       | Remove the file hello.txt                  |
| cat hello.txt      | Print the contents of hello.txt            |
| echo Hello, World! | Print the message Hello, World!            |

Exercise: Create a folder named `Tutorial1` in the `engg1810` folder and `cd` into it. 

Hint: You can press the `<tab>`  in the terminal to auto complete! Tap it twice to see possible auto complete options. 

Hint 2: You can press the `<up>` and `<down>` arrow keys on your keyboard to get the previous and next commands you have typed!


## [T1 Q3] - Hello, World! 
Hello, World! is usually the first go-to program everyone writes, and for good reason! It introduces you to the basic syntax (grammar) of the language and also verifies that your system is set up correctly! 

1. Open your favourite text editor. 
2. Write the following code:
```python
print('Hello, World!')
```
3. Save the file with the filename `hello.py`. You have now just created a program called `hello.py`!
4. Open the terminal and `cd` to where you saved the file.
4. Run your program in the terminal using the command `python3 <program name>`!

Your program will print `Hello, World!` to standard out (which in this case is the terminal screen)!

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

## [T1 Q4] - Box
Write a program called `box.py` that will print the following box to the screen:

```python
$ python3 box.py
+-------+
|       |
|       |
|       |
+-------+
```

**Note:** Lines that start with a `$` represent a terminal command. I.e. `python3 box.py` should be typed into the terminal by YOU, and should not be outputted by your program!

## [T1 Q5] - String variables
A variable is an imaginary storage box you can put information in. 

A string is a data type that contains characters. They are usually surrounded in single quotes ' ' or double quotes " ". 

In Python, there is no difference whether you use single or double quotes!

You can create a variable that stores a string like this:

```python
first_name: str = 'Santa'
last_name: str = 'Claus'
```

*Note*: the `: str` part specifies that the variable is a string, i.e. a piece of text! These are called Python type hints, and while not compulsory or strictly enforced, we highly recommend you use them wherever possible.

### Part 1: 

Create a new variable called `full_name` whose value is `first_name + last_name` and print `full_name` to the screen.

Hint 1: `c = a + b`

Hint 2: `print(c)`

## [T1 Q6] - Numbers and Variables

There are three types of Number data types in Python:
| Type of Number | Description                     |
|----------------|---------------------------------|
| int            | Integer, a whole number         |
| float          | Floating point, decimal numbers |
| complex        | Describes imaginary numbers     |

We won't be dealing with complex numbers, but keep in mind that they exist. 

### Part 1:

- Create two variables called `a` and `b` and give them the starting values of `1` and `2` respectively.
- Create another variable called `c` and give it the value of `a + b`.
- Print the value of `c` to the screen. Is it what you expect?

### Part 2: 

- Change the `+` operator to the `-` operator. 
- Print the value of `c` to the screen. Is it what you expect?
- Try the `*` and `/` operators. What do they do?

### Part 3:

- Returning to [T1 Q5], what happens when you try to minus strings? (i.e. `first_name - last_name`) Try reading the last line of the output and see if you can decipher what it is saying. Does it make sense to minus a string by another string?
- What about the `*` and `/` operators? (Actually do these, don't skip this). Does it make sense to multiply or divide a string by another string?

### Part 4:

- Try to multiply a string with a number. E.g.:

```python
a: str = "Hi!"
b: int = 5
print(a * b)
```

String multiplication is Python-only syntax. 

## [T1 Q7] - Floats

So far we have only dealt with integers (whole numbers). Working with floats are more-or-less the exact same except now we can use decimal points!

### Part 1: 

Try the following code:

```python
a: float = 0.1
b: float = a * 5
print(b)

c: int = 1
print(c)

d: float = 1.0
print(d)
```

Do you see any difference in the output of `c` and `d` in the terminal? Can you deduce what data types `c` and `d` are from the output of your program?

### Part 2:

Floats are useful, but have a very dangerous property that you must be aware of called **floating point rounding error**. 

Try the following code: (tested on Python 3.6.9)

```python
a: float = 0.1
b: float = 0.2
c: float = a + b

print(c)
print(c == 0.3)
```

Does python think `c` is equal to `0.3`? 

In the financial world, floats are rarely used for this specific reason. Instead, money is more often stored as an integer in cents. That way there won't ever be any floating point rounding errors! Beware! The details of why this happens will be the discussion of a later class!

There are some tricky scenarios such as `1/3` (fractions) of a dollar but that is beyond what we need to learn here!

## [T1 Q8] - Boolean variables and equality operator

Boolean data type variables are either `True` or `False`. Simple! (Be careful about the capitalisation!)

### Part 1:

Try out the following code:

```python
a: bool = True
print(a)

b: bool = False
print(b)
```

### Part 2: 

- Create two variables called `a` and `b` whose initial values are both `'test'` . 

- Try the following:

  ```python
  c: bool = (a == b)
  print(c)
  ```

- What do you think `==` is? (Hint: it's in the title for this question) What was stored in `c`? 

- Try changing the value of `b` so that it is not equal to a. What is now printed?

## [T1 Q9] - Functions

> A function is a block of organized, reusable code that is used to perform a single, related action.  [(source)](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/computer_programming/computer_programming_functions.htm)

Look at the following diagram for an overview of how functions work:

<p align="center">
  <img src="./T1Q8P1.svg" />
</p>

Here, `int()` is a function that converts a given string and returns (outputs) an integer. 

`print("Hello, World!")` is also a function! Guess what it took in as an input!

### Part 1:

- Try the following piece of code. Is there a difference between the two print statements? 

```python
a: str = "Hello, World!"
print(a)
######################
print("Hello, World!")
```

### Part 2:

- Try the following piece of code. What is the difference between `a` and `b`?

```python
a: int = 1
b: str = "1"

print(a)
print(b)
```

### Part 3:

- Add the following line of code to Part 2:

```python
print(a + b)
```

What does the error message say? (Hint: You cannot add an integer and a string! It makes no sense!)

### Part 4:

Python provides two in-built functions called `int()` and `str()` which convert a given input into their respective data types. 

- Continue from your code in part 3.
- Create a new variable called `c` whose initial value is `a` but converted to a string. 
- Run Part 3 again with `b` and `c` now.
- Do you see what you expect? What does it mean to add a string to a string? (Hint: this is called string concatenation)

### Part 5:

- Continue from your code in part 4.
- Create a new variable called `d` whose initial value is `b` but converted to an integer. 
- Run Part 3 again with `a` and `d` now.
- Do you see what you expect? What does it mean to add a number to a number? (not a trick question)

It is very important that you understand the differences between numbers and strings. In Python it is very easy to make these mistakes!

## [T1 Q10] - Inputs (stdin / standard in)

Now that we understand some basic ideas of programming, let's spice up our programs to include user inputs. 

Python has yet another in-built function called `input()`. It takes in a single string as an input, prints it to the screen, waits for the user to input something, and then returns (outputs) what the user typed in **as a string**. 

Try out the following code:

```python
# Example 1
name = input("Hello! What is your name? ")

print("Nice to meet you, " + name + ".")
```

Here is the same program written slightly differently:

```python
# Example 2: Same as example 1
print("Hello! What is your name? ")
name: str = input()

message: str = "Nice to meet you, " + name + "."
print(message)
```

### Part 1:

Write a program that performs **exactly** like the following:

```makefile
$ python favourite_show.py
Hello! 
What is your favourite show? #Steins Gate
What type of show is it? #Anime
Your favourite show, Steins Gate, is a Anime!
```

### Part 2:

Write a program that performs **exactly** like the following:

```makefile
$ python hello_there.py
Hello! 
What is your first name? #Naruto
What is your last name? #Uzumaki
Nice to meet you, Naruto Uzumaki.

What is your age? #21
Amazing! Just another 79 years before you turn 100.
```

Note: Inputs are prepended with a `#`. These are things that the user types into the terminal!

Hint: You will need to convert the input into an integer for the age. A trick to find the type a variable holds is to do: `print(type(my_variable))` (this is an example of a nested function call!). `type()` is a function!

Hint 2: To add a string and an integer together, you'll need to convert the integer into a string. 

## [T1 Q11] - Temperature Conversion

Write a program that converts Fahrenheit to Celsius. The equation to convert is given by:

$$
C = \frac 59 (F-32)
$$

Your program should output the following:

```makefile
$ python3 fah_to_cel.py
What degrees in Fahrenheit would you like to convert to Celsius? 180
That is roughly equivalent to 82 degrees Celsius.

$ python3 fah_to_cel.py
What degrees in Fahrenheit would you like to convert to Celsius? 181
That is roughly equivalent to 83 degrees Celsius.
```

Hint: Use the `round()` function to round to the nearest integer. 

## [T1 Q12] - Control flow -> `if`

Control flow is an important topic in programming. It allows us to execute specific branches depending on the current state of the program. Up until now, all of our programs executed down one branch. Now we will have different branches.

`if` is a keyword that takes in a single boolean. If it is True, it's branch will execute.

Try the following code:

```python
if 10 > 5: # Note the colon : symbol which denotes the start of a new block.
    print("10 is indeed greater than 5.") # Code inside the block must be indented with 4 spaces (or a tab).
```

Note: Python does not accept files that mixes spaces and tabs as indentation. You may receive an IndentationError. If you run into such an issue, look for a setting to make `tabs and spaces` visible. Good editors will resolve all tabs to 4 spaces or vice versa, so you shouldn't run into issues. 

### Part 1: Checking power level

Write a program that asks the user for their power level. Make the program output a different response depending on whether the user's power level is over 9000 or not.

```makefile
$ python3 power_level.py
Vegeta, what does the scouter say about his power level? #8000
It's not over 9000...

$ python3 power_level.py
Vegeta, what does the scouter say about his power level? #9001
IT'S OVER NINE THOUSAND!!!
```

## [T1 Q13] Quadratic Solver

Write a program that asks for 3 numbers, (`a`, `b`, `c` that correspond to the general quadratic equation $ax^2 + bx + c$) and output the possible solutions by using the quadratic formula:

$$
x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}
$$

If the determinant $(b^2 - 4ac)$ is less than 0, output "No solutions.".

```makefile
$ python quadratic_solver.py
Enter a: #2
Enter b: #3
Enter c: #1
x1: -0.5, x2: -1.0

$ python quadratic_solver.py
Enter a: #1
Enter b: #0
Enter c: #0
x: 0.0

$ python quadratic_solver.py
Enter a: #5
Enter b: #4
Enter c: #2
No solutions.
```

Note: Make sure you round your solution to 1 d.p. using the `round()` function

Hint: Note: In Python the power operator is `**`, not `^`.

Hint 2: You can do the square root operation by taking the power of a half: $\sqrt{n}$ = $n^{\frac{1}{2}}$ = `n ** 0.5`
